# Stored Program Concept

Early computers e.g. ENIAC were fixed program machines

Programs were wired into the machines. (Data and programs were treated separately.)


Von Neumann and Turing independently proposed what has become known as the stored program computer.

A computer architecture that allows programs and data to reside together in memory. The contents of memory is interpreted as an instruction.
